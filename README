# Backup Git branches before rebasing

[x] reduce `pre-rebase.sample` to something useful for further testing
[x] implement auto-branching with static name ("_REBASE_BACKUP")
[ ] check for & delete existing _REBASE_BACKUP branch
[ ] implement dynamic backup naming ("BRANCH-backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS"); How to intercept branch name from command & still execute it with modified name?
